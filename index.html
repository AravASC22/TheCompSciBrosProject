            Development, Data Science, Digital Marketing, and UX/UI Design are taught. Many people who attend these
            bootcamps may have had a technical background in other subjects such as math, physics, biology,
            chemistry,
            etc, or are transitioning from one field into the tech industry. Coding bootcamps usually have an
            intensive
            curriculum that can consist of website development programming languages like JavaScript, Ruby on Rails,
            PHP, and other languages such as Java and C#. Coding bootcamps can range from part-time for people in a

         Basic knowledge of coding and the thought process involved when coding are incredibly helpful to know when
         pursuing a career in the computer science field. While there are many career opportunities here that do not
         require programming skills. Having basic knowledge of them even if you aren't good at it or plan to pursue it
         is still helpful.

      The following resources are great for learning coding on your own:
      <ul>
         <li>
            W4Schools
            <ul>
               <li>
               This website contains information on how to use many different functions and gives a
               demonstration of them in action that you can edit. While this website isn't the best for starting out or
               learning how to complete specific tasks, it allows you to figure out how the parts you'll need to complete a
               larger task actually work.
               </li>
            </ul>   
         </li>
         <li>
            Stack Overflow
            <ul>
               <li>
                  This website is a public forum where people ask questions about code. More often than not,
                  somebody has already asked the question you seek an answer to. This can be very helpful for solving specific
                  problems you encounter while completing a task.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            Project Euler
            <ul>
               <li>
                  This website is a collection of hundreds of challenges that start out small and very easy
                  and become increasing difficult. Completing challenges like these are a great way to get into programming.
                  If ever you are unsure of how to complete a certain task, you can search for a command by its description or
                  name that you think would help in either of the two websites listed above. If neither of those work out for
                  you, Google is always there to help you. It may feel discouraging to not know anything that you need to do
                  and have to google commands, but that is all part of the process of learning. As you progress, you'll
                  remember some of the commands that you used, and figure out how to fit them together to accomplish specific
                  tasks.
